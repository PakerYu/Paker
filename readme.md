## Version

### v 1. 0. 0

​	This version is my first try of Snake game. It uses character to display but not graphic, cus I just want to realize the function and have no energy to print the graphic at first (It's difficult to achieve GUI by C Lang…). The code is prolix I know… But I will inprove it in later versions (when I have enough time…). (●'◡'●) 

### v 2. 0. 0

​	I started to use the famous library, "EasyX". This tool is really easy to use, just like its name.

​	I didn't do a big modification (Maybe I reminded the whole...) on primary parts, which are used for calculation. I will optimize the code style and logics in later versions (when I have enough time…). (●'◡'●)

​	I have no talent and patience to draw a beautiful interface, so when you open the game, you will find the simple colors — black and white — formed the window… Forgive me… Maybe that's for I haven't used the tool will. But at least, it is a good start of a new journey~



### v 2. 0. 1

​	**Because of the character format error, I didn't  upload the version 2. 0. 0**

​	I fix the error, and decide to set the new version as official version.  (￣︶￣)
