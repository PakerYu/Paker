# Snake

by Paker


## Explain

*This is a small game, which I used to practice my programming level.*

**Written by C Language.**


## Version

### v 1. 0. 0

​	This version is my first try of Snake game. It uses character to display but not graphic, cus I just want to realize the function and have no energy to print the graphic at first (It's difficult to achieve GUI by C Lang…). The code is prolix I know… But I will inprove it in later versions (when I have enough time…). (●'◡'●) 

### v 2. 0. 0

​	I started to use the famous library, "EasyX". This tool is really easy to use, just like its name.

​	I didn't do a big modification (Maybe I reminded the whole...) on primary parts, which are used for calculation. I will optimize the code style and logics in later versions (when I have enough time…). (●'◡'●)

​	I have no talent and patience to draw a beautiful interface, so when you open the game, you will find the simple colors — black and white — formed the window… Forgive me… Maybe that's for I haven't used the tool will. But at least, it is a good start of a new journey~



### v 2. 0. 1

​	**Because of the character format error, I didn't  upload the version 2. 0. 0**

​	I fix the error, and decide to set the new version as official version.  (￣︶￣)



### v 2. 1. 0

​	**Animation Added! ! !**

​	The interface changed little (maybe no change). But the snake could **move smoothly**.

​	I rewrote 70% of the code, classified the code into different file. 

​	It ensures 25 frames displayed between the snake walk through a grid. After testing, it proved that the snake still crawl fluently with high moving-speed, big length (As long as your PC's performance is strong enough~). 



### v 2. 1. 1

​	**Add the function of cache clearing.**

​	When I try the application, I find it has a bug: I forgot to free the Sections space in memory when players choose to Restart, so after gaming many times, many useless data will floating in memory…
