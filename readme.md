# Snake

## by Paker



*This is a small game, which I used to practice my programming level.*

**Writed by C Language.**



### v 1.0.0

​	This version is my first try of Snake game. It uses character to display but not graphic, cus I just want to realize the function and have no energy to print the graphic at first (It's difficult to achieve GUI by C Lang…). The code is prolix I know… But I will inprove it in later versions (when I have enough time…). (●'◡'●)
